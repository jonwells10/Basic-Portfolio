    <!-- Biography Paragraph One -->
<P> 
    My Name is Jonathon Wells originally from Cedar Falls in the deep heart of a state know as the fields of opportunity. Ultimately I ended up moving from  
Iowa in the summer of 2007 for more lucrative opportunities in Minnesota.  However before leaving Iowa I obtained 2 year Associates Degree with a Major in 
Laser/Electro Optics.  For the last 10 years I've worked as a Manufacturing Technicain in the Medical Device industry, and am currently employed by Heraeus 
Medical Components.  I enjoy the work but have been looking for a new opportunity in a field that could allow me to explore my creative side.  I believe that
web developement will allow me to explore my creative side while also allowing me to learn something new everyday which should keep things very interesting

    <!-- Biography Paragraph Two -->

<P> 
    Outside of work and school you can typcially find me haning out with family and friends.  I've always been a huge sports fanatic so whether it's playing them 
or the older I get watching, I've always enjoyed the spontaneity and competiveness that is involed with sports. My favorite teams are the Minnesota Vikings
and Boston Red Sox. I'm also a big music fan and while I enjoy all types of music you'll mostly find me listening to Rap and Hip/Hop. With some of my favorite artist
being Jay-Z and Wiz Khalifa.  Back in the day you could catch me listening to alot of Boyz II Men, or Tyrese really love the slow jams then.  So if you are viewing 
this page take it nice and slow, and I hope you enjoy the content.  Also please don't hesitate to reach out to me via the contact page.
